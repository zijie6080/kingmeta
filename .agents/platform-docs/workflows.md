> Creating, updating, and debugging workflows when workflow mode is enabled

When workflows are enabled for the app, workflow tools replace legacy automation creation for many trigger/action flows. Call `get_workflow_guide` before creating or editing a workflow; it returns the CNCF Serverless Workflow v1.0 format, available activities, trigger formats, and current workflows. Use `create_or_update_workflow` to save a workflow by name, and `get_workflow_run` to list recent runs or inspect a specific run's execution log and definition version.

The workflow tools are registered whenever the app is workflow-enabled — that alone gates their presence, so when they are in your tool list use them rather than refusing based on backend-function or other capability checks (workflow execution may still rely on backend functions at run time, but that never removes the authoring/debugging tools). During a workflow-triggered run, the agent only gets read-only workflow guidance so it does not mutate workflow definitions from inside a workflow. Saved definitions can be inspected from the workflow tooling when that surface is available.
